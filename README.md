# portfoliochallenge2
This is my first attempt at a working portfolio so I made a copy of the example that was given to us, it meets most of the acceptance criteria except one, clicking the first image application doesn't direct you to another site because I believe we weren't told what site to link it to.  They also resize and responds to the correct and wanted sizes at the starting 1440 pixels, 768 pixels and 425 pixels.  Pseudo classes were made use of in all the nav and most img elements. The working links are About Me, Work, Contact Info, chuyieng@gmail.com, Github and Facebook.
 
#resources
 Images were pull from google images from the sites
  wallpaperaccess.com
  surfertoday.com
  photowall.com
  wallpapersafari.com
  unsplash.com
  
  Codes were also pulled from a couple sites to help finish the portfolio
  devoloper.mozilla.org
   - br {display: none;}
   - filter: brightness()
  
  The CSS may be a bit messier than what was expected but along the way of my learning I try to clean it up better
